php-to-s3
---------

####Upload an entire source directory recursively to *Amazon S3* from a PHP command line interface. The connection with *S3* is over SSL.####

All objects are stored using the following *S3* options:

+ private ACL permissions
+ standard storage
+ server side encrypted *(AES256)*

Usage
-----

Set your **AWS ACCESS KEY** and **AWS SECRET KEY** directly in `php-to-s3.php`, or if your feeling fancy in environmental variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SECRET_KEY`.

```` bash
usage: php -f php-to-s3.php <bucket-name> <source-dir>
````
    
Examples
--------

```` bash
# Relative source path
php -f php-to-s3.php my-bucket ../backups/
````

```` bash    
# Absolute source path
php -f php-to-s3.php my-bucket /mysql/backups/
````

```` bash
# Get the version of php-to-s3
php -f php-to-s3.php version
````

Limitations
-----------

+ The bucket must already exist, i.e. it is **not lazy created**.
+ The bucket must be located in the **US West (Oregon)** region, unless you modify `$s3->setEndpoint("s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com");`
+ Files larger than **2GB** are not supported on **32 bit** systems due to PHPâ€™s signed integer problem.
