php-to-s3
---------

Upload and entire source directory recursively to *Amazon S3* from a PHP command line script. The connection with *S3* is over SSL.

All objects are stored using the following *S3* options:

+ private ACL permissions
+ standard storage
+ server side encrypted *(SSE AES256)*

Usage
-----

    usage: php -f php-to-s3.php <bucket-name> <source-dir>
    
Examples
--------

    # Relative source path
    php -f php-to-s3.php my-bucket backups
    
    # Absolute source path
    php -f php-to-s3.php my-bucket /mysql/backups
    

Limitations
-----------

+ The bucket must already exist, i.e. it is **not lazy created**.
+ The bucket must be located in the `US West (Oregon)` region, unless you modify `$s3->setEndpoint("s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com");`
+ Files larger than **2GB** are not supported on **32 bit** systems due to PHPâ€™s signed integer problem.
